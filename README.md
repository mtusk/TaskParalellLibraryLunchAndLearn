Task Parallel Library Lunch & Learn
================================

Applications that hang get no love from users. Asynchronous programming has been receiving more attention recently as responsiveness is now expected. Task Parallel Library (TPL) is a set of public types and APIs introduced in .NET 4, and expanded on in .NET 4.5 to help simplify writing asynchronous code. In this Lunch and Learn, we'll go over the basics of using TPL, how it differs from other asynchronous programming models, and what to watch out for when using TPL.

This is some demonstrative code created for a presentation at Magenic describing Task Parallel Library to be held on May 21, 2013.
